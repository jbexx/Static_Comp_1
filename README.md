This is a Static Comp of the first Image above.  It is a fully responsive design using flexbox and setting media queries for break points at certain screen widths to continue a flow of an aesthetic layout.  I started with a mobile first approach, designing the initial page for a mobile device of a screen width of 320px.  From there I scaled up and as the layout became stretched and not aesthetically pleasing, I put a break point in with a media query and adjusted the layout to come back into a proper, usable design.
